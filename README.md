# DCReconNet：Distortion-Corrected Image Reconstruction with Deep Learning on an MRI-Linac
Authors: Shanshan Shan

This repository contains the implementation of DCReconNet for distortion-corrected image reconstruction using Pytorch-gpu. For a quick test, the trained weights can be used. The folder Test_data contains the testing brain images.

The architecture of the DCReconNet:
